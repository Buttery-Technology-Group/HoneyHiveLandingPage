        Honey is always making sure those connected to the Hive are communicating against known sources-of-truth and
        evaluating their trustworthiness. This gives greater control and security for the Honey platform. Enterprise
        customers get even deeper control through customizing the sources-of-truth Honey uses for their Hive.
